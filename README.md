Heart Disease UCI - Data analysis
The main objective of this project is to use R language to analyze a dataset related to heart disease. The dataset is available in UCI Center for machine learning and Intelligent systems: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease

Why Heart Disease?
•	Heart disease or Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally: more people die annually from CVDs than from any other cause*.
•	An estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2016, representing 31% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% are due to heart attack and stroke*.
•	Over three quarters of CVD deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries*.

II.	Data Set Information 

This dataset contains 14 attributes  from 4 different Hospital:
1.	Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest 
2.	University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland
3.	University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland 
4.	V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio, USA

Attribute Information:

1.	Age 
2.	Gender : 0 for female, 1 for male 
3.	CP : chest pain:  4 values:
		  1: typical angina*
  		2: atypical angina
  	  3: non-anginal pain
	4: asymptomatic

*  Angina is the medical term for chest pain or discomfort caused by a temporary disruption in the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart. People describe angina discomfort as a squeezing, suffocating or burning feeling – usually in the centre of the chest, behind the breastbone.

4.	Trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5.	Chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl 
6.	FBS: fasting blood sugar:
        FBS <120 mg/dL is normal  Value 0
		    FBS >120 mg/dL is diabete  Value 1

7.	RestECG: resting electrocardiographic results, values:
        0 - Hyperthropy
        1 - Normal
        2 - st-t wave abnormality
8.	Thalach : maximum heart rate achieved  in beats per minute (bpm)
9.	Exang : exercise induced angina : 1 = yes; 0 = No
10.	Oldpeak : ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest 
11.	Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment 
12.	CA:  number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy 
13.	thal: The heart status as retrieved from Thallium test 
     3 = normal
     6 = fixed defect; 
     7 = reversable defect 
14.	Goal:    0 indicates that the patient hasn’t heart disease, the values 1,2,3 and 4 patient diagnosed :
      1- diagnosed with stage 1,
      2- diagnosed with stage 2, 
      3- diagnosed with stage 3, 
      4- diagnosed with stage 4.
